# Model Process

https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/process.html


With minimal knowledge of the problem or data at hand, it is difficult to know which ML method will perform best. This is known as the no free lunch theorem for ML (Wolpert 1996). 

Approaching ML modeling correctly means approaching it strategically by 
- spending our data wisely 
- on learning and validation procedures
-  properly pre-processing the feature and target variables, 
- minimizing data leakage (Section 3.8.2), 
- tuning hyperparameters, and 
- assessing model performance
